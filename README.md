## Welcome to my "Eurovaalit" repository

During my three-month stint as a Research Trainee in the Statistics and Research Unit at the City of Vantaa, I had the opportunity to work on a draft version of a website. This website was intended to showcase the primary statistics and analysis of the European Parliament Elections that took place in May 2019.

My main responsibility was to analyze the data from these elections, and the results were primarily made available in PDF or paper format. The election data was imported from a government website. As my traineeship neared its end, I decided to explore how we could present this analysis in a more accessible format, specifically as a website. To achieve this, I utilized RStudio and RMarkdown for the coding work.

The resulting website is primarily in Finnish and was designed to provide a user-friendly platform for accessing the election statistics and analysis. For the best experience, we recommend using the Microsoft Edge browser when viewing the site.

Here is the [website link](https://breezewindx.github.io/eurovaalit/).

The site contains (through drop-down menus on the top)
1. Alkusanat / Foreword by head of the election office
2. Tietoa vaaleista / Information about the elections
  - Äänestysaktiivisuus / Voter turnout
  - Vaaliehdokkaat / Election candidates
  - Äänestystulokset / Election results
  - Parlamenttiin valitut / Elected to Parliament
3. Kartat / Maps
  - Äänestysaktiivisuus / Voter turnout
  - Suosituimpien puolueiden kannatus / Support of the most popular parties
    
Being just a website draft, please note that site navigation is executed simply by clicking tabs, and a complete website navigation is not available.

For exploring a more in-depth data-analysis depository, please see my [IODS course project](https://github.com/BreezewindX/IODS-project/tree/master) , which is my repository of the course "Introduction to Open Data Science", which was a graduate/post-doc level course that I once took.
