## Welcome to my "Eurovaalit" repository

During my three-month tenure as a Research Trainee in the Statistics and Research Unit at the City of Vantaa, I had the opportunity to outline and demonstrate how the results would appear on a website. This website was created to showcase the primary statistics and analysis of the European Parliament Elections that took place in May 2019.

My main responsibility involved analyzing the original election data, which was obtained from a government website. As my traineeship approached its conclusion, I decided to explore ways to present this analysis in a more accessible format, specifically as a website. To accomplish this, I utilized RStudio and RMarkdown for the coding work.

It's worth noting that the resulting website, being a quick first draft, may not be as user-friendly as desired. It is primarily in Finnish and was designed with the aim of offering a preliminary platform for accessing the election statistics and analysis. For an optimal experience, please consider using the Microsoft Edge browser when viewing the site.

Here is the [website link](https://breezewindx.github.io/eurovaalit/).

The site contains (through drop-down menus on the top)
1. Alkusanat / Foreword by head of the election office
2. Tietoa vaaleista / Information about the elections
  - Äänestysaktiivisuus / Voter turnout
  - Vaaliehdokkaat / Election candidates
  - Äänestystulokset / Election results
  - Parlamenttiin valitut / Elected to Parliament
3. Kartat / Maps
  - Äänestysaktiivisuus / Voter turnout
  - Suosituimpien puolueiden kannatus / Support of the most popular parties

Here is the direct link to [my course diary](https://breezewindx.github.io/IODS-project/). Due to the numerous graphs included, loading may take a moment.
